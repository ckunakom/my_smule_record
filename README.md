# My Smule Record
This is a repo to house my personal Smule project.

I  initially created this just for my own curiosity. I wanted to know how many songs I have done and I wanted a list of those songs. Because I had to do this similar to how I did ETL for my class, I thought I would make a webpage out of it to add to my portfolio as a way to add my personality to my page.
